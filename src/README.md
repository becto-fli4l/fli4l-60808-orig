fli4l
=====

fli4l is a **router distribution** based on the Linux kernel which can operate
on hardware based on at least an Intel Pentium CPU with MMX extensions
(or compatibles). fli4l supports various protocols for upstream connections
(e.g. ISDN, DSL, or Ethernet).

The required boot media can be created under Linux or Microsoft Windows.
Special **Linux knowledge is not required**. A basic knowledge of networking,
however, is very helpful. Beginners should first take a look at the [Wiki](https://web.nettworks.org/wiki/display/f/fli4l-Wiki).

fli4l is **highly modular**. This enables you to create a router tailored to
your very needs. For example, you can include packages to connect networks over
the Internet using encrypted tunnels (VPNs), to protect clients from potential
dangers when surfing by using proxies, or to let fli4l run within a virtual
machine (KVM, XEN). In addition, fli4l can be **easily extended** with your own
packages. However, basic knowledge of Linux and reading the developer
documentation is a precondition here. These extensions can then be placed
in a central database and used by other fli4l users.

fli4l can be **easily installed** on hard drives, memory cards, USB sticks,
or compact discs.

Try it out and have fun with fli4l!
