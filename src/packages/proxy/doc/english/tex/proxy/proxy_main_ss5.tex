For some programs a Socks proxy may be needed. SS5 provides this
functionality.

\config{SS5\_LISTEN\_N}{SS5\_LISTEN\_N}{SS5LISTENN}

\config{SS5\_LISTEN\_x}{SS5\_LISTEN\_x}{SS5LISTENx}

        {Specify IP addresses or symbolic names including portnumber of
        the interface here on which SS5 should listen to clients.
        It is a good idea to specify only trusted interfaces because
        all clients have full access to SS5 (and its activated
        configuration editor). Normally setting \var{IP\_NET\_1\_IPADDR:8050}
        makes most sense.

        SS5 will listen to the addresses set here offering its
        services. The default port is 8050. This setting has to be used
        in the configuration of your programs.

        Define your fli4l name (see \var{HOSTNAME} in base.txt) or its
        IP (i.e. 192.168.6.1) as a proxy in your client. With the port
        number set here all data necessary to configure programs
        for using SS5 is provided.}

\config{SS5\_ALLOW\_N}{SS5\_ALLOW\_N}{SS5ALLOWN}

        {Sets the number of list entries.}

\config{SS5\_ALLOW\_x}{SS5\_ALLOW\_x}{SS5ALLOWx}

        List of nets and/or IP addresses for which the packet filter
        has to be opened. Default: \var{IP\_NET\_1}.
