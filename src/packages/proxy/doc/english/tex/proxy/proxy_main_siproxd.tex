\subsection{OPT\_SIPROXD (experimental) - Proxy for Session Initiation Protocol}
\configlabel{OPT\_SIPROXD}{OPTSIPROXD}

If SIP tools (Ekiga, x-lite or Hardware SIP-Phones) have to be used
behind a router it may be needed that network ports are redirected
for connections to work properly.

To avoid this a special SIP Proxy-Server can be used. At the time
of writing (fli4l V4.0.0) several such Proxys are being evaluated.
If someone can suggest a good choice please inform us!
