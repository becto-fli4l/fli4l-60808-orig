\section{CHRONY - Inform other applications about timewarps}

If chrony notes that the clock is significantly away from the current time, it
corrects the time in one great step and starts scripts to inform other applications
about this timewarp. For example to inform imond about a timewarp, chrony does the
following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item include scripts into the archive

Chrony includes two files to the archive:

\begin{verbatim}
imond  yes  etc/chrony.d/timewarp.sh mode=555 flags=sh
imond  yes  etc/chrony.d/timewarp100.imond mode=555 flags=sh
\end{verbatim}

timewarp.sh starts all scripts in the same folder which names are 
timewarp$<$3 numbers$>$.$<$name$>$.

\item provide script

chrony includes the following script into the archive:

\begin{verbatim}
# inform imond about time warp
imond-stat "adjust-time $timewarp 1"
\end{verbatim}

Hence imond will be informed about the timewarp and is able to correct it's 
internal timebase.
\end{enumerate}
