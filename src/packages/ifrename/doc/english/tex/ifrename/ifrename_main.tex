\textbf{ifrename} - Rename network interfaces based on various static criterias\\


Ifrename is a tool allowing you to assign a consistent name to each of your network interfaces.\\
\\
By default, interface names are dynamic, and each network interface is assigned the first available name (eth0, eth1...). The order in which network interfaces are created may vary. For built-in interfaces, the kernel boot time enumeration may vary. For removable interface, the user may plug them in any order.\\
\\
Ifrename allows the user to decide what name a network interface will have. Ifrename can use a variety of selectors to specify how interface names match the network interfaces on the system, the most common selector is the interface MAC address.\\
\\
Ifrename must be run before interfaces are brought up, which is why it's mostly useful in various scripts (init, hotplug) but is seldom used directly by the user. By default, ifrename renames all present system interfaces using mappings defined in /etc/iftab\\

\achtung {ifrename was designed for use in a ethernet router and not tested with configurations,
where internet connections are established over dial-up.\\
\\
The package changes boot order, disables ethernet interfaces and reactivates them afterwars
with their new names assigned. Please pay attention to use these changed names in all config
files for the router.\\
\\
The user is completely responsible for any changes made and to adaptall files accordingly.\\
\\
You may at first try the functions of this package in avirtual environment at first before
adapting it to your working system!}
