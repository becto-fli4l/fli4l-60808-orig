# Broadcasts a message. The message data is passed in variables that are named
# <message-type>_<parameter>.
#
# $1 = type of message to be broadcast
# $2 = (optional) type of message to be received as a reply
# $3 = (optional) timeout for waiting for the reply
# Output: If no reply has been requested, the number of receivers is displayed.
#         Otherwise, the parameters of each received reply message are printed.
#         Furthermore, the two additional variables 'expected_count' and
#         'actual_count' are printed, where the first one contains the number
#         of receivers and the second one contains the number of replies that
#         arrived in time.
# Returns: 0 on success and non-zero on failure
