== FAXRCV/src ==

Not all sources used to build included programs are shipped
together with faxrcv, because most of them are available
on the internet.

capifaxrcvd
-----------
Available at: ftp://ftp.isdn4linux.de/pub/isdn4linux/utils/
Version in use: 3.2p1 (capifaxrcvd 1.2 with patches)

OPT_FAXRCV makes use of the capifaxrcvd from the isdn4k-utils
packet. The patches in this directory need to be applied to
the sources of v1.2 before building.
Below is a list with the patches and what they're doing.

* capifaxrcvd.c-v1.2-lostfaxes.patch (fe)
Avoids a nasty bug that may cause faxes to be deleted.

* capifaxrcvd.c-v1.2-minix.patch (jw5)
  +++ OBSOLETE +++
  This patch is not needed anymore as of fli4l 2.1.7 (minixfs
  is not used any more). This patch will be removed within the
  next few versions!
  ++++++++++++++++
This is required to allow the capifaxrcvd to store its faxes
on a minix partition (filenames are cut to 32 chars). Note that
after this patch has been applied the notify-command (-n) is no
longer called with the filename as parameter but instead with
two paramters: first is the full name as it would have been
used before the patch has been applied and the second is the
actual filename on the fs.
