V0.153, 30. September 2000
------
 all Changes by Juergen Bauer: jb@idowa.net

 - Added posibility for using modulparameters:
   lines for number of lines, cols for number of cols,
   io for io_adress of LPT-Port, t_short and t_long to controll the timing
 - new Cursormodes: on, blinking, underline, off
 - removed: hardware.h we donot need it anymore. We can use modulparameters
 - new in tools/ isdn_rate. It shows the downloadrate of the isdn interface

V0.152, 15. June 1999
------
 - Added new delay function in order to reduce system-load. It will call
   schedule() in order to let other processes run on longer delays. This
   saves just 0.1% CPU time on my 533MHz Alpha. Maybe this can be more on
   other machines.
 - Minor driver change for proper compiling with 2.0.* kernels (oops ;)
 - Added some Makefile additions for the driver and a new program in the
   tools/ directory (lcdtime).
   Thanks go to Chris <chris@obelix.bene.dabay.net> for this!
