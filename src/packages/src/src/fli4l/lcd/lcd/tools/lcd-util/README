		WORK IN PROGRESS !
	Don't complain, you have been warned ;)

This will become the place for some utilities and support functions for the
LCD display module driver. At the moment the only useful thing is
  textrun.c
which exports a function scrolling a textstring by a defined amount of
characters like
  Hallo
  alloH
  lloHa
  loHal
  oHall
  Hallo

Have fun!
Any additions are always welcome...
