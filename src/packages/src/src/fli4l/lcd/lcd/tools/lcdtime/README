Display the time on an Hitachi-2x16-LCD-Display connected to your
computer's parport. This is IBM-PC-specific and uses
the driver from

 http://www.unix-ag.uni-siegen.de/~nils/lcd.html

On the LCD, it looks like this:

  Time  Date
 +----------------+
 |21:23 13. Jun 99|
 |@807.6 Sunday   |
 +----------------+
  Beats  Weekday

Time and date are in your local timezone.
 
`Beats' is some silly marketing-idea from swatch,
which they call the `Internet time'. Essentially they
divide a day in 1000 intervals and you can calculate
B=(H*60+M)/1.44 with H,M hour and minute GMT.
