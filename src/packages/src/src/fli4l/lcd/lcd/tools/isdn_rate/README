isdn_rate V0.2 by Juergen Bauer jb@idowa.net
--------------

isdn_rate shows some system status an the isdn-rates for 
input and output in kb/s and as a bar on the LCD panel.
It is intended for a 4x20 display. For other sizes feel free to change the
code, but please send me your changes ;)
Just typing 'make' will build the program itself.
To run it simply do
  isdn_rate > /dev/lcd

I usually install it in my rc.local file:
  nice /usr/local/bin/isdn_rate > /dev/lcd &

It's major code is from proclcd and parts of KISDN, so please have a look 
at the source!
