Demo programs for self defined characters
-----------------------------------------

To build the programs just type 'make'.


wave:
	To run just type
		./wave > /dev/lcd
	It will display a sine-wave scrolling from right to left using
	vertical bar graph characters to have a smoother wave. The waiting
	time between each frame is by default 60000 Micro seconds which is
	quite fast. You can specify another time value on the commandline
	just by
		./wave 250000 > /dev/lcd
	which is quite slow.
