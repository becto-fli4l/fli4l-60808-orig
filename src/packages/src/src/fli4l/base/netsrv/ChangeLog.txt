======================
2009-03-21 version 1.0
======================
netsrv is a small library simplifying the development of small TCP/IP and
UDP/IP server applications. It has been separated from the srv868 utility v1.0
where the main parts come from. Changes and extensions include:

* patch from Jean Wolter (jw/fli4l) integrated:
  - fixes a resource leak where the server socket of an accepted connection was
    not closed in the non-forked master process
  - fixes a possibly never ending loop while handling termination of child
    processes
* function-scope exception framework implemented for better error handling
  (to avoid resource leaking problems in the future), including test program run
  by "make check"
* signal handling simplified
* Makefiles overhauled

* corrections and improvements for UDP servers
* new function netsrv_net_read_some() which is especially useful for reading

* version information included into library
