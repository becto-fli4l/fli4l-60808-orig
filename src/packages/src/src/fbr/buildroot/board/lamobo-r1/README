General
=======
The Lamobo R1, also known as Banana Pi Router or BPi-R1, is a board based on
the Allwinner A20 System-on-Chip (SoC). The dual-core CPU implements the Cortex
A7 design which is based on the ARMv7 architecture.

Hardware
========
The board comes equipped with
- 1 GiB DDR3-RAM,
- one Micro SD card slot accepting cards up to 64 GB,
- one Serial ATA connector, accepting disks up to 2 TB,
- one 5-port network switch based on a Broadcom 53125 chip,
- one Realtek 8192cu wireless adapter,
- two USB 2.0 ports, one type A port and one On-the-Go (OTG) port.

More details can be found under http://wiki.lamobo.org/index.php/Lamobo_R1.

This directory contains a hardware description (Device Tree) for the board
called sun7i-a20-lamobo-r1.dts. This file is compiled into a Device Tree Blob
(DTB) on kernel creation.

Booting
=======
U-Boot is used for booting. First, the board code loads the SPL (Secondary
Program Loader) into SRAM, which then initializes the DRAM, loads and starts
the real U-Boot loader. The U-Boot loader then loads the Linux kernel, the
initramfs, and the device tree blob into memory and starts the kernel.

The memory layout is as follows (cf. include/configs/sunxi-common.h):

0x40000000: start of DRAM
0x40008000: start of unpacked Linux kernel; the kernel's load address and
            entry point must be set to this address
0x42000000: start of uImage containing the kernel
0x43000000: start of device tree blob
0x43100000: start of optional boot script
0x43300000: start of optional RAM disk (initrd or initramfs)
0x4A000000: start of U-Boot loader

It follows that without patching U-Boot,
- the kernel uImage may not exceed 16 MiB,
- the unpacked kernel image may not exceed 32 MiB - 4 kiB,
- the DTB may not exceed 1 MiB,
- the initramfs may not exceed 109 MiB.

The boot loader relocates the DTB and the initramfs to high memory such that
they end near to 0x50000000 (i.e. near the 256 MiB limit). This is to leave
room for the Linux kernel to be decompressed if necessary. The 256 MiB limit
stems from the fact that 256 MiB RAM are the minimum found on the various
Allwinner board configurations.
