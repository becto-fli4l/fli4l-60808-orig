cups.mk.diff (kristov)
* Installs cups into /usr/local/cups to avoid a conflict
  with lprng binaries.
* Adds missing dependency on openssl.

cups-makefile.patch (kristov)
* Installs cups-config into /usr/bin.

cups-fix-stack-protector-check2.patch (kristov)
* Does the same as cups-fix-stack-protector-check.patch, but patches
  configure instead of config-scripts/cups-compiler.m4. This is beacuse
  CUPS_AUTORECONF=YES does not work.
