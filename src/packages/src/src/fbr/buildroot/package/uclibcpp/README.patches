uclibcpp-makefile.patch (kristov)
* Allows LDFLAGS read from the command line to be extended.

0001-no-exception-class.patch (kristov)
* Don't include definitions of exception classes. They are not used, and the
  underlying type (_Unwind_Exception_Class) differs fundamentally between
  ARM platforms and non-ARM platforms, which makes it impossible to handle the
  definitions platform agnostic.
