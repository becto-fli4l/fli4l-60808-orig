9000-ipv6only.patch (kristov)
* Adds support for setting the IPV6_ONLY socket option (needed for IPv6-only
  tunnels) on any socket without generating an error message by simply
  ignoring protocol mismatch. This simplifies the generation of the stunnel
  configuration when using multiple tunnels with different layer-3 requirements.
