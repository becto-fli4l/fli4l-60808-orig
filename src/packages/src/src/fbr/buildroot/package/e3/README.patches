9001-makefile.patch (kristov)
* Fixes makefile by defining EXMODE and by linking executable using '$(LD)'.
  The default mode of creating e3 under Linux does not use 'ld' and produces a
  binary which is broken after being stripped. However, uClibc buildroot
  always strips all binaries, so we cannot use this build method.
