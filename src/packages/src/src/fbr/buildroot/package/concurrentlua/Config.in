	  ConcurrentLua is a system that implements a concurrency model for the Lua
	  programming language. It is based on the share-nothing asynchronous
	  message-passing model that is employed in the Erlang programming language.

	  ConcurrentLua extends Lua's coroutines with message-passing primitives, in
	  order to support concurrent programming. Distributed programming is supported
	  transparently with the same message-passing primitives.

	  ConcurrentLua is implemented as a collection of Lua modules that can be
	  loaded by any Lua program. Most of the code is written in Lua itself, with
	  minor parts written in C.
