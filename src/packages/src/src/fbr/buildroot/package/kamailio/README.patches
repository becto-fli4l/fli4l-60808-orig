kamailio-dont-use-readline.patch (kristov)
* Don't use readline. The detection algorithm wrongly searches for readline
  headers on the build host and may enable the use of the readline library
  inadvertantly.

kamailio-no-build-info.patch (kristov)
* Don't include the build date/time and compiler information into the binary.

kamailio-paths.patch (kristov)
* Corrects the usage of various paths.
