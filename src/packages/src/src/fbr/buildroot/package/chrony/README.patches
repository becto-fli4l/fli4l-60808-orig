chrony-notify-apps.patch (jw5)
* Provides a generic framework to inform other applications about timewarps
  caused by chronyd. If chronyd advances the clock in one big step it invokes
  scripts in /etc/chrony.d and passes the time offset as parameter to them.
  See /etc/chrony.d/timewarp.sh and /etc/chrony.d/timewarp100.imond for an
  example.
