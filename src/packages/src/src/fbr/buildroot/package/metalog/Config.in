	  Metalog is a modern replacement for syslogd and klogd. The logged
	  messages can be dispatched according to their facility, urgency,
	  program name and/or Perl-compatible regular expressions. Log files
	  can be automatically rotated when they exceed a certain size or age.
	  External shell scripts (e.g., mail) can be launched when specific
	  patterns are found.

	  Metalog is simple to configure, accepts unlimited number of rules and
	  has (switchable) memory bufferization for maximal performance.
