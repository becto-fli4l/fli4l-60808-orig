\section {mc - Midnight Commander}
}

\subsection {Description}
  This package provides the program Midnight Commander, which
  is a free clone of the DOS tool Norton Commander.
  As a result, maintenance work becomes easier for fli4l maintainers
  not familiar with the command line. The program is started by executing
  the command 'mc' on the console.

\subsection{Configuration}

\begin{description}

\config{OPT\_MC}{OPT\_MC}{OPTMC}{}
  Specifying \var{'no'} here deactivates OPT\_MC completely.\\
  To activate OPT\_MC set \var{OPT\_MC} to \var{'yes'}.

\end{description}
