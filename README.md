## fli4l-60808-orig: Time Capsule for fli4l-4 / r60808 ##

The last testing version of fli4l was released in 2022/10/14
→ the read-only svn repository is currently still online → so here is (a part|checkout) of the original svn repository as a time capsule on github.

The time capsule helps you to create a fli4l installation folder from the latest svn revision (r60808) and is also a template for further development of the software on your own computer.

Since fli4l is designed as a router or firewall, essential components should only be downloaded from secure sources, so fork the repo and use → https://github.com/becto-fli4l/fli4l-60808-orig/blob/trunk/_dl_repo.nettworks.org.sh to get a verified download from original sources.
